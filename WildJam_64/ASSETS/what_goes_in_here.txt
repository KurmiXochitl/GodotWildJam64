the ASSETS folder is reserved solely for files that are READY and directly interacted with,
either in the editor or in-game.

Enviromental: includes [Decor, MeshLibraries, tilemaps, and anything the player 
directly interacts with in its "final state"] anything thats ready to be used 
in-game for artistic purpouses

Characters: Finished, ready to play with cahracters. Each new character needs to 
be in its own folder

Toys: anything the player has control over its behavior. I.E: a gun, the player
 chooses what to shoot with it, a ball they bounce it, etc.. 


























(Im low key digging this folder settup. I'm going to save a copy of it for next time
