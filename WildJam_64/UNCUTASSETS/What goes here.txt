The UNCUTASSETS folder is probably going to look like a horrid nightmare
 when we're done, but this is where you should drop any raw imports and try to
avoid too many "Subfolders" that opens us up to a risk of file corruption if 
something gets moved in the FileSystem. 

its okay to just drag and drop directly into the UNCUTASSETS folder, not everything 
needs an individual folder (like a .png of a cactus), but if you'd like to make your own individual 
folder that'd be a good way to keep track of everything you contributed to the project 
so far!
