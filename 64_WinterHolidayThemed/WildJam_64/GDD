2.5 Game Flow Summary - How does the player move through the game? What is the visual style?

Lighting is a key element to the gaeemeplay so everything is set at night with omni lighsts providing the majority of illumination. 
The player’s playstyle dictates the effect on the wowrld (i.e: more violent solutions lead to more lethal enemies as player moves to a new stage) stealth is rewarded by weaker enemies in the long run, but more traps and patrols from enemies. 
The player consumes enemies and darkness to regen stats and breakable objevcts litter the maps. 
The player will also be able to glow momentarily in the dark which can act as a way to find traps in the shadows. 
(The goal right now is) a shadowy player hunting or fleeing from a city of local people and depending on how the player plays, their infamy level decides how the townspeople tell your legend. as a violent beast or as a mischievous imp.
